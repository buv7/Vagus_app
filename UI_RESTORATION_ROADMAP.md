**Key Goals**:
1. ‚úÖ Fix 2 critical broken features (Week 1-2)
2. ‚úÖ Complete 6 high-value incomplete features (Week 3-5)
3. ‚úÖ Build 10 missing workout widgets (Week 6-8)
4. ‚úÖ Polish secondary features (Week 9-10)
5. ‚úÖ Production readiness (Week 11-12)
6. üîç Evaluate archived features (Week 13+)

**Success Criteria**:
- Zero critical bugs
- All core user flows functional
- Professional UX polish
- Performance optimized
- Security reviewed
- Ready for beta users

---

## Phase 1: Critical Fixes (Week 1-2)

### Goal
Restore broken user-facing functionality that blocks core workflows.

### Tasks

#### 1.1 Fix PDF Export (Priority: CRITICAL)
**File**: `lib/screens/workout/workout_plan_viewer_screen_refactored.dart:1026`

**Problem**: Windows path resolution breaks PDF generation

**Solution Steps**:
1. Read current PDF export implementation
2. Identify path resolution issue (likely `path_provider` Windows compatibility)
3. Implement cross-platform path handling:
   ```dart
   // Use path_provider properly
   final directory = await getApplicationDocumentsDirectory();
   final filePath = '${directory.path}/workout_plan_${plan.id}.pdf';
   ```
4. Test on Windows, macOS, Linux
5. Handle permissions (storage access)
6. Add error handling and user feedback
7. Remove "temporarily disabled" message

**Estimated Effort**: 1-2 days
**Dependencies**: `pdf`, `path_provider` packages
**Testing**: Export on all platforms, verify PDF opens

---

#### 1.2 Implement Intake Form Response Viewer (Priority: CRITICAL)
**File**: `lib/screens/coach/intake/coach_forms_screen.dart:869`

**Problem**: Coaches cannot view client intake form responses (incomplete workflow)

**Solution Steps**:
1. Design UI for response viewer (modal or full screen)
2. Create data model for form responses
3. Implement Supabase query to fetch responses:
   ```dart
   final responses = await supabase
     .from('intake_form_responses')
     .select('*, intake_forms(*)')
     .eq('client_id', clientId)
     .order('created_at', ascending: false);
   ```
4. Build response detail view (show all fields)
5. Add filtering by form type
6. Add export to PDF/CSV option
7. Link from client profile and forms screen

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: Supabase schema (verify `intake_form_responses` table)
**Testing**: Submit form as client, view as coach

---

#### 1.3 Complete File Preview Navigation (Priority: HIGH)
**Files**: Multiple in `lib/screens/files/` and `lib/widgets/files/` (8 instances)

**Problem**: Users can upload files but cannot preview or navigate file details

**Solution Steps**:
1. List all 8 TODO instances and affected screens
2. Create unified file preview screen:
   - Image preview (zoomable)
   - Video player
   - Document viewer (PDF, etc.)
3. Implement navigation from file lists
4. Add file metadata display (size, date, uploader)
5. Implement file actions menu (download, share, delete)
6. Add breadcrumb navigation
7. Handle file not found errors

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Dependencies**: `flutter_pdfview`, `video_player`
**Testing**: Upload various file types, preview each

---

#### 1.4 Add Missing Meal Model Fields (Priority: HIGH)
**Files**: `lib/widgets/nutrition/meal_timeline_card.dart` + data models

**Problem**: Meal model missing critical fields (id, timestamps, mealType, photo_url)

**Solution Steps**:
1. Review current `Meal` model definition
2. Add missing fields to model:
   ```dart
   class Meal {
     final String id;
     final DateTime? checkedInAt;
     final DateTime createdAt;
     final MealType mealType; // enum: breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack
     final String? photoUrl;
     // ... existing fields
   }
   ```
3. Create database migration if needed:
   ```sql
   ALTER TABLE nutrition_meals ADD COLUMN checked_in_at TIMESTAMPTZ;
   ALTER TABLE nutrition_meals ADD COLUMN meal_type TEXT;
   ALTER TABLE nutrition_meals ADD COLUMN photo_url TEXT;
   ```
4. Update all Meal instantiations in codebase
5. Update meal_timeline_card to use new fields
6. Fix macro calculations to use correct data
7. Test nutrition tracking end-to-end

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Dependencies**: Database migration, model updates
**Testing**: Log meals, verify data persists correctly

**Solution Steps**:
1. Define completion criteria:
   - % of exercises completed
   - % of sets logged
   - Weighted by difficulty/volume?
2. Implement accurate calculation:
   ```dart
   double calculateCompletion(WorkoutDay day) {

- Analytics (coach dashboard)
- Skipped sessions alerts (coach inbox)

**Steps**:
1. Review migration file: `supabase/migrations/migrate_workout_v1_to_v2.sql`
2. Verify schema matches code expectations:
   - Current migration has: `user_id`, `day_id`, `started_at`, `completed_at`
   - Coach inbox needs: `client_id`, `status`, `scheduled_date`
3. Decide:
   - **Option A**: Update migration to match all code needs
   - **Option B**: Update code to use migration schema + add views
4. Apply migration to database
5. Re-enable commented queries in:
   - `coach_inbox_service.dart:225-242`
   - `workout_analytics_service.dart:347-355, 839-845`
6. Test thoroughly

## Risk Management

### High-Risk Areas

#### Risk 1: workout_sessions Table Deployment
**Impact**: HIGH (blocks Phase 2 features)
**Mitigation**:
- Deploy early in Phase 2 (Week 3)
- Thorough testing before dependent features
- Have rollback migration ready

#### Risk 2: Performance Degradation
**Impact**: MEDIUM (poor UX)
**Mitigation**:
- Profile early and often
- Set performance budgets
- Automated performance testing

#### Risk 3: Scope Creep
**Impact**: MEDIUM (timeline slips)
**Mitigation**:
- Stick to roadmap priorities
- Defer non-critical features to post-launch
- Use feature flags for gradual rollout

#### Risk 4: Third-Party Dependencies
**Impact**: LOW-MEDIUM (package issues)
**Mitigation**:
- Pin package versions
- Test package upgrades in isolation
- Have fallback plans for critical packages
