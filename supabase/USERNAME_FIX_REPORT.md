# Username Fix Report - Coach Profiles Table

**Date**: 2025-10-15
**Database**: Supabase PostgreSQL (kydrpnrmqbedjflklgue)
**Region**: EU Central 1 (AWS)
**Connection**: Session Pooler (port 5432)

## Executive Summary

Successfully diagnosed and fixed the missing `username` column in the `coach_profiles` table. The column has been added, indexed, and populated with data from the `profiles` table.

## Diagnostic Results

### 1. Coach Profiles Table Schema (Before Fix)

The `coach_profiles` table was missing the `username` column. Initial schema:

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable |
|------------|-----------|----------|
| coach_id | uuid | NO |
| display_name | text | YES |
| headline | text | YES |
| bio | text | YES |
| specialties | ARRAY | YES |
| intro_video_url | text | YES |
| updated_at | timestamp with time zone | NO |
| is_active | boolean | YES |
| marketplace_enabled | boolean | YES |
| rating | numeric | YES |

### 2. Profiles Table Verification

✓ Confirmed that the `profiles` table has a `username` column (TEXT, nullable)

## Actions Taken

### 1. Added Username Column
```sql
ALTER TABLE coach_profiles
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS username TEXT;
```
**Status**: ✓ Successfully executed

### 2. Created Performance Index
```sql
CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS idx_coach_profiles_username ON coach_profiles(username);
```
**Status**: ✓ Successfully created

### 3. Data Migration
```sql
UPDATE coach_profiles cp
SET username = p.username
FROM profiles p
WHERE cp.coach_id = p.id AND cp.username IS NULL;
```
**Status**: ✓ Updated 2 coach profiles (on first run; 0 on subsequent run as data already populated)

## Final State

### Coach Profiles Table Schema (After Fix)

| Column Name | Data Type | Nullable | Notes |
|------------|-----------|----------|-------|
| coach_id | uuid | NO | Primary key |
| display_name | text | YES | |
| headline | text | YES | |
| bio | text | YES | |
| specialties | ARRAY | YES | |
| intro_video_url | text | YES | |
| updated_at | timestamp with time zone | NO | |
| is_active | boolean | YES | |
| marketplace_enabled | boolean | YES | |
| rating | numeric | YES | |
| **username** | **text** | **YES** | **NEWLY ADDED** |

### Sample Data Verification

Current coach profiles with username:

| Coach ID | Username | Display Name | Updated At |
|----------|----------|--------------|------------|
| 7639dd28-4627-4926-a6b0-a948e6915aa2 | coach1 | Fitness Coach 1 | 2025-10-15 19:06:31 |
| 8e1753c8-996f-44ce-a171-fb16e9160948 | coach2 | Wellness Coach 2 | 2025-10-15 19:06:31 |

### Statistics

- **Total Coaches**: 2
- **With Username**: 2 (100%)
- **Without Username**: 0 (0%)

## Database Objects Created

1. **Column**: `coach_profiles.username` (TEXT, nullable)
2. **Index**: `idx_coach_profiles_username` on `coach_profiles(username)` for faster lookups

## Connection Details Used

- **Method**: Session Pooler (recommended for serverless applications)
- **Port**: 5432
- **SSL**: Enabled with TLS
- **Connection String**: `postgresql://postgres.kydrpnrmqbedjflklgue:[REDACTED]@aws-0-eu-central-1.pooler.supabase.com:5432/postgres`

## Recommendations

### 1. Application Code Updates

Update any queries that reference `coach_profiles` to include the `username` field:

```dart
// Example Flutter/Dart code
final coaches = await supabase
    .from('coach_profiles')
    .select('coach_id, username, display_name, headline, bio, specialties, is_active')
    .eq('is_active', true);
```

### 2. Data Consistency

Consider adding a trigger to keep `coach_profiles.username` synchronized with `profiles.username`:

```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE FUNCTION sync_coach_profile_username()
RETURNS TRIGGER AS $$
BEGIN
  IF NEW.username IS DISTINCT FROM OLD.username THEN
    UPDATE coach_profiles
    SET username = NEW.username
    WHERE coach_id = NEW.id;
  END IF;
  RETURN NEW;
END;
$$ LANGUAGE plpgsql SECURITY DEFINER;

CREATE TRIGGER on_profile_username_update
  AFTER UPDATE OF username ON profiles
  FOR EACH ROW
  EXECUTE FUNCTION sync_coach_profile_username();
```

### 3. Validation

Add a NOT NULL constraint if usernames are mandatory:

```sql
-- First ensure all records have usernames
UPDATE coach_profiles cp
SET username = p.username
FROM profiles p
WHERE cp.coach_id = p.id AND cp.username IS NULL;

-- Then add constraint
ALTER TABLE coach_profiles
ALTER COLUMN username SET NOT NULL;
```

### 4. Unique Constraint

If usernames should be unique across coaches:

```sql
CREATE UNIQUE INDEX idx_coach_profiles_username_unique
ON coach_profiles(username)
WHERE username IS NOT NULL;
```

## Files Created

1. **C:\Users\alhas\StudioProjects\vagus_app\supabase\migrations\fix_username_diagnostic.sql**
   - SQL migration file with all diagnostic and fix queries

2. **C:\Users\alhas\StudioProjects\vagus_app\supabase\scripts\fix_username_diagnostic.js**
   - Node.js script for executing queries and generating reports

3. **C:\Users\alhas\StudioProjects\vagus_app\supabase\USERNAME_FIX_REPORT.md**
   - This comprehensive report

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Verify column exists in coach_profiles table
- [x] Verify index was created successfully
- [x] Verify data migration completed
- [x] Verify all existing coaches have usernames
- [ ] Test application queries that use coach_profiles
- [ ] Test coach profile creation workflow
- [ ] Test coach profile update workflow
- [ ] Monitor query performance with new index

## Rollback Plan

If needed, the changes can be rolled back with:

```sql
-- Drop the index
DROP INDEX IF EXISTS idx_coach_profiles_username;

-- Drop the column
ALTER TABLE coach_profiles DROP COLUMN IF EXISTS username;
```

**Note**: This will permanently delete username data from coach_profiles, but the original data remains in the profiles table.

## Next Steps

1. Update application code to use the new username field
2. Consider implementing the synchronization trigger
3. Test the application thoroughly
4. Monitor query performance
5. Consider adding constraints based on business requirements

## Conclusion

✓ The username column has been successfully added to the coach_profiles table
✓ All existing coach profiles have been populated with usernames from the profiles table
✓ Performance index has been created for efficient username lookups
✓ Database is now ready for application queries that require username in coach_profiles

The fix has been applied successfully with zero data loss and no downtime.
