@supabase query "SELECT cc.coach_id, cc.client_id, p1.name as coach_name, p2.name as client_name, cc.status FROM user_coach_links cc JOIN profiles p1 ON cc.coach_id = p1.id JOIN profiles p2 ON cc.client_id = p2.id LIMIT 10"
```

### 8. Database Health Check
```
@supabase query "SELECT schemaname, tablename, pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename)) as size FROM pg_tables WHERE schemaname = 'public' ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(schemaname||'.'||tablename) DESC LIMIT 10"
```

### 9. Check Table Counts
```
@supabase query "SELECT 'profiles' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM profiles UNION ALL SELECT 'ai_usage', COUNT(*) FROM ai_usage UNION ALL SELECT 'user_coach_links', COUNT(*) FROM user_coach_links"

- Tables are listed correctly
- Queries execute successfully
- Claude can see your VAGUS project data

‚ùå **Connection Issues:**
- "MCP server not found" errors
- "Authentication failed" messages
- Empty results when data should exist
- Timeout errors

## üîß If Tests Fail

1. **Check MCP Configuration:**
   - Verify config file is in correct location
