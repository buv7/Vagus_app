# 🔧 Coach Marketplace - RELATIONSHIP ISSUE FIXED!

## 🚨 **CRITICAL FIX APPLIED**

### **Root Cause Identified**: Foreign Key Misconfiguration
- **Problem**: `coach_profiles.coach_id` was pointing to `auth.users` instead of `profiles`
- **Impact**: Supabase couldn't find relationship between tables
- **Error**: "Could not find a relationship between 'coach_profiles' and 'profiles'"

### **Solutions Implemented**:

#### 1. **Fixed Foreign Key Constraint** ✅
```sql
-- Dropped incorrect constraint pointing to auth.users
ALTER TABLE coach_profiles DROP CONSTRAINT coach_profiles_coach_id_fkey;

-- Added correct constraint pointing to profiles
ALTER TABLE coach_profiles ADD CONSTRAINT coach_profiles_coach_id_fkey 
FOREIGN KEY (coach_id) REFERENCES profiles(id) ON DELETE CASCADE;
```

#### 2. **Created RPC Function Fallback** ✅
```sql
CREATE FUNCTION get_marketplace_coaches(search_query, limit_count, offset_count)
-- Bypasses relationship syntax with direct SQL JOIN
```

#### 3. **Updated App Query Logic** ✅
```dart
// Replaced problematic relationship syntax:
// .select('coach_profiles!inner(...)') 

// With reliable RPC function call:
final response = await _supabase.rpc('get_marketplace_coaches', {...});
```
