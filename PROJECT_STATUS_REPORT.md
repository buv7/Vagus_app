## ✅ Completed Phases

### Phase 1: Archive & Cleanup (2025-10-02)
**Objective:** Archive unused/disconnected files while preserving git history

**Actions Completed:**
- ✅ Created `/archived/` folder structure with 5 categories
- ✅ Moved 10 files using `git mv` (preserved full history)
- ✅ Fixed all broken imports in active codebase
- ✅ Created comprehensive `archived/README.md`
- ✅ Verified no hardcoded credentials

**Files Archived:**
```
/archived/shims/           (2 files) - Legacy compatibility exports
/archived/tests/           (4 files) - Test/debug code
/archived/stubs/           (1 file)  - OneSignal service stub
/archived/disconnected/    (2 files) - Functional but unused features
/archived/documentation/   (1 file)  - OneSignal setup docs
```

**Impact:**
- Analyzer errors: 965 → 56 (all remaining in archived/ and test/ only)
- Codebase clarity improved
- Zero deletions (all code preserved)
