## üéØ Best Practices

### Program Design
- **Progressive Overload**: Use %1RM fields to plan progression week-to-week
- **Volume Landmarks**: Check analytics to ensure 10-20 sets per muscle group per week
- **Recovery**: Balance high-intensity days with lower-volume or rest days
- **Variety**: Mix training methods (straight sets, supersets, circuits) for engagement

### Client Communication
- **Day Notes**: Explain the "why" behind each training day
- **Exercise Notes**: Pre-empt form questions with detailed cues
- **Intensity**: Use RIR and %1RM to guide effort levels
- **Cardio Instructions**: Specify exact machine settings for consistency

### Workflow Efficiency
- **Templates** (Coming Soon): Save your favorite splits and protocols
- **Duplicate Weeks**: Use for linear periodization (same structure, increasing weight)
- **Bulk Planning**: Build all weeks first, then go back to fine-tune details
- **Mobile Review**: Final check on mobile to ensure client-facing UX is perfect
